# Unleash the Power of Azure Open AI

![](/images/intro.png)

# üìò Prerequisites

1. [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/): To deploy and run AzureChatGPT, you'll need an Azure subscription with access to the Azure OpenAI service. Request access [here](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUOFA5Qk1UWDRBMjg0WFhPMkIzTzhKQ1dWNyQlQCN0PWcu). Once you have access, follow the instructions in this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) to deploy the gpt-35-turbo or gpt-4 models.

2. Setup GitHub or Azure AD for Authentication:
   The [Add an identity provider](#add-an-identity-provider) section below shows how to configure authentication providers.

   üí°Note: You can configure the authentication provider to your identity solution using [NextAuth providers](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/)

# üëãüèª Introduction

AzureChatGPT is built with the following technologies.

[Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en): an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

[Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/docs): enables you to create full-stack web applications by extending the latest React features

[NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/): configurable authentication framework for Next.js 13

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a series of predefined classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

[Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-GB/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/): fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) NoSQL database to store chat history

[Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/): fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends.

# üíô One click Azure deployment

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fazurechatgpt%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fmain.json)

Click on the Deploy to Azure button and configure your settings in the Azure Portal as described in the [Environment variables](#üîë-environment-variables) section.

Please see the [section below](#ü™™-add-an-identity-provider) for important information about adding authentication to your app.

# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Run from your local machine

Clone this repository locally or fork to your Github account.

1. Create a new file named `.env.local` to store the environment variables add the following variables

   ```
   - azure-open-ai-accelerator
   # azure open ai related configurations
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME=
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=

   # github OAuth app configuration
   AUTH_GITHUB_ID=
   AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=

   # Azure AD OAuth app configuration
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=
   AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=

   # when deploying to production, set the NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable to the canonical URL of your site. https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options

   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

   AZURE_COSMOSEDB_URI=
   AZURE_COSMOSEDB_KEY=
   ```

2. Install npm packages by running `npm install`
3. Start the project by running `npm run dev`

You should now be prompted to login with GitHub. Once you successfully login, you can start creating new conversations.

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to Azure - GitHub Actions

### üß¨ Fork the repository

Fork this repository to your own organisation so that you can execute GitHub Actions against your own Azure Subscription.

### üóùÔ∏è Configure secrets in your GitHub repository

### 1. AZURE_CREDENTIALS

The GitHub workflow requires a secret named AZURE_CREDENTIALS to authenticate with Azure. The secret contains the credentials for a service principal with the Contributor role on the resource group containing the container app and container registry.

1. Create a service principal with the Contributor role on the resource group that contains the Azure App Service.

   ```
   az ad sp create-for-rbac
      --name <NAME OF THE CREDENTIAL> --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP> --sdk-auth --output json
   ```

2. Copy the JSON output from the command.

3. In the GitHub repository, navigate to Settings > Secrets > Actions and select New repository secret.

4. Enter AZURE_CREDENTIALS as the name and paste the contents of the JSON output as the value.

5. Select Add secret.

### 2. AZURE_APP_SERVICE_NAME

Under the same repository secrets add a new variable `AZURE_APP_SERVICE_NAME` to deploy to your Azure Web app. The value of this secret is the name of your Azure Web app e.g. `my-web-app-name` from the domain https://my-web-app-name.azurewebsites.net/

### üîÑ Run GitHub Actions

Once the secrets are configured, the GitHub Actions will be triggered for every code push to the repository. Alternatively, you can manually run the workflow by clicking on the "Run Workflow" button.

# ü™™ Add an identity provider

Once the deployment is complete, you will need to add an identity provider to authenticate your app.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Only one of the identity provider is required below.

## GitHub Authentication provider

We'll create two GitHub apps: one for testing locally and another for production.

### üü° Development app setup

1. Navigate to GitHub OAuth Apps setup https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Create a `New OAuth App` https://github.com/settings/applications/new
3. Fill in the following details

```
Application name: AzureChatGPT DEV Environment
Homepage URL:http://localhost:3000/
Authorization callback URL:http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github/
```

### üü¢ Production app setup

1. Navigate to GitHub OAuth Apps setup https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Create a `New OAuth App` https://github.com/settings/applications/new
3. Fill in the following details

```
Application name: AzureChatGPT Production
Homepage URL:https://YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME.azurewebsites.net/
Authorization callback URL:https://YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/callback/github/
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Once the apps are setup, ensure to update the environment variables locally and on Azure App Service.

```
   # github OAuth app configuration
   AUTH_GITHUB_ID=
   AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=
```

## Azure AD Authentication provider

### üü° Development app setup

1. Navigate to Azure AD Apps setup https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/RegisteredApps
2. Create a `New Registration` https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/CreateApplicationBlade/quickStartType~/null/isMSAApp~/false
3. Fill in the following details

```
Application name: AzureChatGPT DEV Environment
Supported account types: Accounts in this organizational directory only
Redirect URI Platform: Web
Redirect URI:http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/azure-ad/
```

### üü¢ Production app setup

1. Navigate to Azure AD Apps setup https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/RegisteredApps
2. Create a `New Registration` https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/CreateApplicationBlade/quickStartType~/null/isMSAApp~/false
3. Fill in the following details

```
Application name: AzureChatGPT Production
Supported account types: Accounts in this organizational directory only
Redirect URI Platform: Web
Redirect URI:https://YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/callback/azure-ad/
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Once the apps are setup, ensure to update the environment variables locally and on Azure App Service.

```
# Azure AD OAuth app configuration

AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=
AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=
